Write a program that allows the user to enter a series of exam scores. 
The number of scores the user can enter is not fixed; they can enter any number of scores they want.
The exam scores can be either integers or floats. 
Then, once the user has entered all the scores they want, your program will calculate the average of those scores.
You need to use a while loop to allow the user to enter numbers, one at a time, until some numeric sentinel value is entered. 
I recommend having a sentinel like 999, something unlikely to be confused with an exam score. 
If the user enters a score < 0 or > 100 that is not the sentinel value then that score is to be rejected.
Each time a legit score is entered, however, it should be added (appended) to a list.
Once the user has entered all the numbers they want, 
you should use a for-loop to calculate and display the average of the scores, rounded to 1 decimal place.

To get full credit, you need to do the following.
•	Use a while-loop to allow the user to enter any number of exam scores, one number per line, until a sentinel value is entered.
•	Legitimate exam scores should be added to a list, bogus scores should be rejected. If a bogus score is entered have the user reenter the score.
•	Once all scores have been entered use a for-loop to calculate the average of the scores, rounded to 1 decimal place.
•	Put your name in a comment near the top of the program file.
•	Have the output statement give the number of scores averaged as well as the average itself.
